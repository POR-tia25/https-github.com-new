1. Transportation problem:
Cities 1 and 2 have 100K and 200K passengers per year, respectively. Airports 1 and 2 can accept a demand of 150K and 150K passengers per year, respectively. The city-to-airport driving times are listed at right.
Please formulate the linear programming problem and solve it using GAMS Solver.

2. Shortest path problem
(you can assume the link length as 1 as a default value and try different values as a sensitivity test)
